Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I talked to Michaela Opdahl and Yushan He.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I had a discussion about this homework with professor Hia about ten minutes after Tuesday's class.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
The sytax in java is different than that in python, so I have to check the demo we wrote in the course and search for some syntax knowledge. The logic of java is very clear, so the writing process is good.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Similarities: Both of the two langueages are highly readable. Both of them need to first write constructor and then write functions.
Difference: Java need to define private/public of the attributes and functions. I think this is better than python, because in this way the writer can decide which attributes and functions other can access. The name of constructor in java is the same as the class name, while the name of constructor in python is always "__init__".

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
what worked:
I can easily get the logic between different functions, and figure out what should each function do.

what did not work:
I learned some java in my high school, but during the last semester, I kept writing python and almost forget all the format of java. Thus, in this homework, I spent some time solving the format/syntacx error, checking the usage methods of different classes(like random, scanner), and reviewing the definition of some terms(like the difference between array and arraylist). Finally, I think now I learned much more than I did before I start this homework.

advice:
We need plan before we code. We need to think about the relation between functions and what actions should each function contain.
When we see the error message, we should read carefully and solve it immidiately. 
If we are confused about default functions(for me, like "length" and "len") in some classes, we should use tools to help us learn more.
